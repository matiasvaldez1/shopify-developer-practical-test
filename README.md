# Shopify Theme Development - Matias Valdez

## Overview

For this challenge, given the limited time, I was able to modify the general layout of the footer, update the styling in the header and homepage, and add two of the Figma sections to the homepage. I also created a set of different products and collections to fulfill the requirements of the sections.

If I had more time, I would continue working on completing the section functionalities (such as the card components) and ensuring that everything matches the Figma design precisely, as it is still far from that at the moment.
